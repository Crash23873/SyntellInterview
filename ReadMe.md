## Assesment

You have taken over this project, the previous developer did not check in all he code and the project is in a broken state. You will be asked to fix the project then solve new requirements. There is some supporting code but some problems will require new code.


1. Get it back into a working state, The project will 
be considered in a working a working state when it compiles and is able
to display the current exchange rate to the dollar

    eg. "On 11 of July 2016 $1 will buy you R12.40"


2. Improve or comment on any of the coding practices used, Coding standards, 
Error checking. You have been asked to add some unit tests to the project.
(You do not need to add more than 2 Unit tests)

3. The client feels the value for pounds is wrong and has asked you to investigate.

4. The client has requested that you update the application to also display 
how many Rands a pound will buy.

5. Lastly The Client does not want to pay for the Exchange service but
would like to see the Max, Min and Avg price for the rand compared to the 
dollar for a given month.

    To achieve this you will need to store historic values on the local machine.

    (In the spirit of keeping this sample project short you may assume that you 
only need to process January and save your values in a text file. You can then
read from this file and use it to get the values for January.)

    The output should look something like this and follow the current exchange rate.

    "For the Month of January $1 would buy you a Max of {value} Rands and a Min of {value}
The average for the month was {value}"
